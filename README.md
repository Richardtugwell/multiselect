# Simple Multi-Select

This project demonstrates a simple multi-select component with no dependencies on any libraries other than Angular, RXJS and a little smattering of lodash. It has some basic styles, but you'd normally adapt it for Bootstrap, Foundation, Material etc. Interestingly it doesn't make any use of the traditional `<select>` element.

It is really a demo of how to use Angular CDK selectionModel.
